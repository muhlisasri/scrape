# A COLLECTION OF WEB SCRAPER PROJECT THAT I BUILD TO GRAB CONTENT FROM WEBSITES

# 1. JAKMALL SCRAPER
   Jakmall is a popular ecommerce website in Indonesia. Jakmall become suplier of dropshipper business in Tokopedia and Shopee.
   I use selenium to scrape this Jakmall website. We can't scrape using BeautifulSoup and Requests module because this website use Javascript.
   I collect some information like : Product Title, Price, Description, and Images.

# 2. INSTAGRAM SCRAPER
   In this instagram scraper, I use selenium to make automation. We must login to this website first to scrape the content. So, we can't use
   Requests for this task. The Instagram scraper here, I grab all the post link on instagram's user. With selenium, i load the postings using autoscroll.
